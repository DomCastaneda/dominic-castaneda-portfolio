  Hello! My name is Dominic and I'm a software engineer from Southern California.  
  I'm experienced in all aspects of the software development lifecycle and project management, 
  from planning, designing, building testing, and deployment. I have become a creative problem 
  solver with a passion for developing innovative solutions for complex problems.
  <br><br>
  Something that I love about software development is the opportunity to work on a team and connect with others.
  In my free time you might find me: hiking, running, boxing, cooking, watching anime, fishing, reading A Song of Ice and Fire, 
  or rooting for my favorite sports teams. Iâ€™m eager to meet and learn from other software engineers, so feel free to connect on LinkedIn!
