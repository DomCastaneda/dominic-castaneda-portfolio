  Hello! My name is Dominic and I'm a software engineer from Southern California.  
  I'm experienced in all aspects of the software development lifecycle 
  including: planning, designing, building testing, and deployment. Something that I love about software 
  development is the opportunity to work on a team and connect with others. Iâ€™m eager to meet 
  and learn from other software engineers, so feel free to connect on LinkedIn!
